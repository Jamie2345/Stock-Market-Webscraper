You will need: os, requests, beautiful soup (bs4), pandas and matplotlib

wherever it says PATH-TO-SPREADSHEET change it to the same location eg. C:\Users\name\stock prices scrapper\my spreadsheet (you don't need to create a spreadsheet yourself the program will do that for you and it will also delete old spreadsheets so you don't need to worry about it taking up space)

Run the scraper program then a few seconds after run the graph program. (the scraper program scrapes the website and adds data to a csv and the graph program reads that csv in real time and plots the data)

heres an image of me running it for just bitcoin: https://imgur.com/a/j0J2CUY
